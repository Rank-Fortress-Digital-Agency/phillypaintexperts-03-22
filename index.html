                    I’m noticing my wood starting to rot, can it be salvaged?

                    Wood is a great material for building with, but it can be susceptible to rot if not properly treated. We will get straight to answer of this post which is, yes, painting wood will actually slow the process of rot and make your wood last longer. While this may seem like an unimportant topic, I assure that anyone who has ever had to replace their deck or fence because of rot will find this information useful!

                    We are here today with some basic tips on how you can paint your wood so that it lasts longer and doesn’t get affected by rot as quickly – no matter what type of environment you live in! There are many different types of paints available out there (oil, latex, etc.), but which one is best for preventing rot?

                    The most important thing to remember is that you should always use the right type of paint. For example, if your wood has already begun to rot don’t try using regular primer and paint because it won’t work! This will only make matters worse by trapping moisture in between layers which can cause even more damage. Instead, go with exterior grade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other paints that are good for preventing wood rot are water based as these are designed to repel water. Acrylic latex is a good example because it’s very durable and resists peeling, flaking or cracking – even in extreme environments!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, you do need to use your honest judgment to tell when the wood is too far past gone. If there is only minor damage, then painting to prevent further will be fine. However, keep in mind that the paint is only protecting help to slow down the problem, it does not repair the wood!

                    In addition to choosing the right paint for preventing rot, you should also clean your wood well before painting over it. This will ensure that all of the dust and debris is removed, and that the wood is fully prepped for a new paint job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To properly prepare your wood prior to painting it, you need to remove any loose material like dirt or peeling paint. After this step has been completed, wash the surface with a detergent solution using warm water.
